    "## Description\n",
    "This game is a unique variant of the well-known pen-and-paper game Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT). However, instead of the usual 2-dimensional 3-by-3 board, Rubik's-Tac-Toe comprises of 6 concurrent games of Tic-Tac-Toe, played on the faces of a Rubik's cube.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis of this game was inspired by [Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe), a TTT variant where the moves of a player determines the board the opponent plays in, as well as [Higher-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_tic-tac-toe).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this game is to score the greatest number of TTT wins across all of the 6 faces, after all the cells on each face have been occupied. Additionally, when a player plays a move that results in a TTT win, they are to turn 1 face of the cube, thereby changing the game states on multiple boards."

    "### Gameplay\n",
    "The implementation of this game is meant for 2 players.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin the game, simply run the file `game.py` in your terminal of choice. Alternatively, you may run the final cell of this notebook to execute the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon running the program, players are prompted to select a symbol to use throughout the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the symbols are selected, a window for the game would appear onscreen. \n",
    "\n",
    "The game comprises of 4 components: \n",
    "1. a play field in the centre, \n",
    "2. navigation buttons around the play field for rotating the cube,\n",
    "3. the scoreboard and,\n",
    "4. a projection of all the boards, in the appropriate orientation, displayed as a cubic net. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main play field represents the game state on the central face of the navigation board. Moves made on the play field are updated and displayed on the navigation board after each move. The green navigation buttons rotate the projection of the cube in the indicated direction, updating the projection at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a player plays a winning move on a board, a `Toggle Controls` button is displayed on-screen and the play field is disabled for the moment. Clicking on this button toggles the controls of the navigation buttons, to allow for the player to navigate the board <font color=green>(green)</font> and select a row to turn <font color=red>(red)</font>. After the rotation is selected, the `Toggle Controls` button is hidden and gameplay continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon conclusion of the game, players may choose to restart or exit."

    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "For our implementation of this game, 3 classes of objects are defined: `Game`, `Cube` and `Board`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is required for this game to use the `tkinter` library, primarily for the generation and display of the gameplay elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we also used `deepcopy` from the `copy` module, as well as `partial` from the `functools` module, to execute and access auxiliary methods/ attributes between each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For smaller gameplay and visual elements, the `time`, `os`, `sys` and `random` modules were also utilised.\n"
